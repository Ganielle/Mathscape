  <Question>k__BackingField: "Sarah has invested 15,000 in a bond that pays an annual
    interest rate of 3.5%. How much will she have in total after 5 years? Use the
    first four numbers as your answer.\n\r\nGiven: \r\nBond value = 15 000\r\nannual
    interest rate = 3.5% or 0.035\r\ntime period = 5 years"

  <Hint>k__BackingField: 'Annual interest = initial investment x annual interest
    rate

    Annual interest = 15 000 x 0.035

    Annual interest = 525

    Total
    interest = annual interest x time period

    Total interest = 525 x 5

    Total
    interest = 2 625

    Total amount = Initial investment + total interest'
