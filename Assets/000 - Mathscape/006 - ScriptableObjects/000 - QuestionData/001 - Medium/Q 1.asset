  <Question>k__BackingField: Sound intensity is often measured on a logarithmic scale,
    where each unit represents a certain multiple of the intensity of the quietest
    sound the human ear can hear. Suppose that a sound is 3 times as intense as the
    quietest audible sound. What is the sound's intensity level on a base-7 logarithmic
    scale?
